# Online-parity goal

This document records the **current primary goal of the codebase** and the plan to
reach it. `REMAINING-BUCKETS.md` is the per-fixture log for the *existing* target;
this file is about the next one.

## The goal

A test binary that, given a **wiki** and a **page title**:

1. fetches the wiki's own (online) Parsoid HTML for the page,
2. fetches that page's wikitext from the same wiki, **cached**,
3. runs the rustoid parser over that wikitext,
4. **compares** the two results, aiming for *exact* equality.

Stated as a target: for a page on a live wiki, rustoid's output should be
indistinguishable from the HTML that wiki's Parsoid produced for it.

Reaching that requires reimplementing all on-wiki extensions, prominently the
**Lua/Scribunto** plugin.

## Why this is a *different* target than the fixture suite

This is the most important thing to understand before starting, and it reframes
the work:

- The 891-fixture suite (`rustoid-core/tests/fixtures/`) exercises Parsoid in
  **standalone** mode. That is what the current 871/891 measures.
- A live wiki serves Parsoid in **integrated** mode. MediaWiki core runs the
  preprocessor and the extensions; Parsoid only renders the resulting token
  stream.

Consequences:

- **Standalone Parsoid does not implement `#invoke` at all.** `baseconfig/enwiki.json`
  lists zero `functionhooks`, and there is not a single `#invoke` in Parsoid's
  own `tests/parser/*.txt`. For an unimplemented parser function standalone
  Parsoid emits the literal error
  `Parser function implementation for pf_<name> missing in Parsoid.`
  (`src/Wt2Html/TT/TemplateHandler.php:580`). So Lua is invisible to the fixture
  suite *by construction* — 871/891 says nothing about it.
- Parsoid ships only *built-in* extension handlers (`src/Ext/`: `Gallery`,
  `Nowiki`, `Pre`, `JSON`, `Indicator`). `Cite` (`<ref>`) and `Scribunto` live in
  MediaWiki core / extension repos and are only present in integrated mode.
- Integrated mode also uses **MW core's preprocessor**, whose edge cases differ
  from Parsoid's standalone one. That is exactly why this repo already documents
  a family of fixtures as `+integrated`-only and "unreachable" — those
  expectations are the integrated-mode results.

So online parity is a **superset** of the current target: it needs everything
already working (tokenizer, tree builder, serializer — shared by both modes)
*plus* MW-core preprocessor fidelity, *plus* the wiki's extensions, *plus* Lua.

The good news: the 871/891 core is re-used as-is. This is additive work, not a
rewrite.

### What "exact equality" cannot mean

Some output is time- and state-dependent: `{{CURRENTYEAR}}`, `{{#time:}}`,
`{{age in days}}`, `{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}`, and any Lua module calling
`os.date`/`mw.language:formatDate`/`mw.site.stats`. The wiki's Parsoid baked in
*its* clock and counters; a replay cannot reproduce those without being told
them. The harness must therefore record the wall-clock time and the relevant
site statistics alongside the fetched HTML, and rustoid must be able to *replay*
them. Pages that cannot be made deterministic are excluded from the byte-exact
score and tracked separately.

## Current inventory (verified, not assumed)

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| Parser core (wikitext → HTML) | **Working** — 871/891 fixtures, 679 lib tests |
| **Comparison harness** (`rustoid-compare`) | **Working** — revid-pinned fetch, persistent per-wiki cache, offline replay, first-difference reporting. 24 tests |
| CLI (`rustoid-cli`) | **Stubs only.** `render`/`roundtrip`/`test`/`serve` all print "not yet implemented" |
| Lua engine (`lua/engine.rs`, 666 lines) | Present: sandbox, 8 `mw` sub-tables, 17 functions, 16 unit tests. **Not wired into the parser** — no `#invoke` dispatch anywhere |
| Extension API (`traits.rs::ExtensionHandler`) | Trait exists; **zero implementations**. Returns `String`, which is too coarse for `mw:Extension/<name>` + `data-mw`/`data-parsoid` |
| Extension tags | Handled *generically*; `nowiki`/`pre`/gallery/i18n special-cased. No Cite, no Scribunto |
| Site config | **Hardcoded** `MockSiteConfig` (enwiki-shaped). No way to load a wiki's real config |
| API data source (`mw_api.rs`) | Exists with in-memory TTL cache. Superseded for this purpose by the harness's cache-backed `DataSource` |
| Persistent cache | **Done** — per-wiki, flushable, offline-capable |
| Corpus / golden files | **Does not exist** |

## Verified API surface (for the harness)

All confirmed live, with `curl`, against `en.wikipedia.org`:

| Purpose | Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Parsoid HTML, latest | `GET /w/rest.php/v1/page/{title}/html` | 200 |
| Parsoid HTML, **revision-pinned** | `GET /api/rest_v1/page/html/{title}/{revision}` | 200 |
| Wikitext at a revision | `GET /w/rest.php/v1/revision/{revid}` → `.source` | 200 |
| Latest revid for a title | `GET /w/api.php?action=query&prop=revisions&rvprop=ids` | 200 |
| Site config | `GET /w/api.php?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=namespaces\|namespacealiases\|magicwords\|functionhooks\|extensiontags\|interwikimap\|general` | 200 |

Two operational facts worth recording now:

- **Rate limiting is real and immediate.** A handful of rapid requests already
  returned `You are making too many requests to the API`. Every fetch needs a
  descriptive `User-Agent`, serialisation with a delay, and aggressive caching.
- **Revision pinning matters.** Fetch the revid first, then fetch both the
  wikitext and the Parsoid HTML *at that revid*; otherwise an intervening edit
  makes the comparison meaningless.

## Plan

Ordered so that measurement comes first: without a scoreboard, the extension and
Lua work is unverifiable.

### Phase 0 — The measurement instrument

**Status: landed** as a separate `rustoid-compare` crate (chosen over a
`rustoid-cli` subcommand so it can be a dev-dependency, stays out of the shipped
`rustoid` binary, and keeps the network dependencies away from the parser).

- [x] Separate `rustoid-compare` crate + `rustoid-compare` binary.
- [x] Revision-pinned client ([`wire`](../rustoid-compare/src/wire.rs)): resolves
      the latest revid, then fetches the wikitext and the wiki's Parsoid HTML *at
      that revid*, so an intervening edit cannot invalidate a comparison.
- [x] **Persistent, flushable, per-wiki wikitext cache**
      ([`cache`](../rustoid-compare/src/cache.rs)): one directory per wiki host
      (`<root>/<host>/index.json` + `pages/<key>.txt`). Bodies are separate files
      so a large cache stays inspectable; the manifest is written write-then-rename
      so a crash cannot truncate it. Keys are sanitised so a wiki-supplied title
      cannot escape the directory. `--flush` drops one wiki, `--flush-all`
      everything.
- [x] Cache-backed `DataSource`, so template and module fetches *during
      expansion* are persisted per title too — verified: one page produced 85
      cached entries.
- [x] `--offline`: a miss is reported as skipped rather than fetched, so a run is
      reproducible and rate-limit-free. Verified: an offline replay of the same
      page returns the identical revid and the identical diff.
- [x] Outcome categorisation (`match` / `differ:<kind>` / `skipped`) for the
      scoreboard histogram.

Verified end-to-end against the live wiki:

```
$ rustoid-compare --wiki en.wikipedia.org --page "UFC BJJ"
UFC BJJ @ r1371233379 — DIFFER
first difference at byte 1:
  parsoid: "<section data-mw-section-id=\"0\" id=\"mwAQ\"><div class=\"shortde"
  rustoid: "<p about=\"#mwt30\" typeof=\"mw:Transclusion\" data-parsoid='{\"pi"
  parsoid 239179 bytes, rustoid 1112120 bytes
```

That size gap is the expected shape of what remains: missing Lua modules and
on-wiki extensions. The instrument itself is what Phase 0 needed to produce.

Still to come in this phase: corpus/batch mode (a list of titles), golden files,
and recording the run's wall-clock time and site stats for replay (see
"What exact equality cannot mean").

### Phase 1 — Site config from the wiki — *done*

- Load `SiteConfig` from `siteinfo` (namespaces + aliases, magic words, function
  hooks, extension tags, interwiki map, general) instead of a hardcoded list, and
  persist it with the cache. — **done** (`rustoid-compare/src/siteconfig.rs`)
- **Exit criterion:** the extension-tag list and namespace table used for a run
  demonstrably come from the wiki, not `mock.rs`. — **met**: `rustoid-compare`
  no longer references `MockSiteConfig`, and a live enwiki run reports
  `28 extension tags, 112 function hooks, 285 magic words, 30 namespaces, 781
  interwiki`, matching a direct `siteinfo` query.

Two non-obvious `siteinfo` wire traps, both now covered by tests:

- The localized namespace name is spelled `*` in formatversion=1 and `name` in
  formatversion=2, so both must be understood.
- `serde`'s `rename = "*"` **silently deserializes to `None`** — it does not
  error. Anything reading a `*` key has to capture the object and index it.

Still to come in this phase: ingesting Parsoid's `baseconfig/*.json` for
fixture-grade offline runs (the parser's own fixture suite already pins its own
configuration and is unaffected).

### Phase 2 — Corpus and scoreboard — *done*

- A curated corpus spanning the failure space: plain prose, tables, infoboxes,
  references, module-heavy, magic-word-heavy, edge cases — plus a random sample
  for breadth. — **done** (`rustoid-compare/corpus/enwiki.txt`, 49 entries,
  compiled in via `include_str!`; `--corpus <file>` takes a custom one).
  Entries are tagged with the feature areas they exercise, verified by
  inspecting each page's wikitext rather than assumed.
- **Exit criterion:** one command prints a score and a diff-category histogram. —
  **met**: `--corpus default` prints a score, a by-outcome histogram, a by-tag
  table, a failure list, and (with `-v`) every first difference.

Two decisions worth recording, both of which changed the numbers' meaning:

- **Two histograms, not one.** By *category* says what the parser did wrong; by
  *tag* says which body of work that maps onto and whether anything passes at
  all. Neither alone is enough: a page yields a single category but carries
  several tags, and a tag whose pages all fail identically is invisible in a
  category tally.
- **Skips are excluded** from the score and the tag table. A page that could not
  be fetched says nothing about parser parity, and counting it as a failure
  would fill the work list with entries that have nothing wrong with them. This
  is what makes an `--offline` run comparable to an online one.

The classification also had to change to be worth anything: it previously
sniffed a 60-byte window around the first differing *byte*, which reflects
position rather than cause — a `<td>` that identifies a table problem is often
several hundred bytes before the byte that actually differs. It now sees 400
bytes on each side, and buckets are ordered most-specific-first so a page whose
only real problem is Lua is not reported as an extension difference.

Building the corpus immediately exposed a **cache correctness bug** that had
been invisible until a template-heavy page was tried. The data source handed to
the parser opened its *own* `WikiCache`, so it held a separate in-memory
manifest from the harness's; the two overwrote each other's `index.json`. Bodies
still landed on disk, so nothing failed — but after a full cold fetch of
`Cristiano Ronaldo` there were **445 template bodies on disk and 3 manifest
entries**, so nearly every template was re-downloaded on every run. A dense page
took 7m28s and only 3 entries survived.

The fix is one shared `Arc<Mutex<WikiCache>>`. While fixing it, `put` was also
decoupled from `write_index`, because re-serialising the whole manifest on each
of hundreds of fetches is quadratic; the manifest is now written every 64
entries and at the end of a run. This matters for what comes next: Lua support
will fetch *more* templates per page, not fewer, so a harness that got slower
with every capability added would defeat the purpose of having one.

Still to come in this phase: golden Parsoid HTML committed in-repo, so
regressions are catchable without network. The cache carries the same
information today, but it is a local artifact rather than a reviewable one.

#### A tokenizer bug the corpus found, and a second one it did not

The first corpus run never finished. `RUSTOID_TRACE_FETCH=1` showed the page
`Israel` requesting `Template:Def` — a template that **does not exist** and
appears in no input — thousands of times. Root cause, in `find_template_closing`
(`rustoid-core/src/wikitext/tokenizer_v2.rs`): a `{{{…}}}` argument reference was
treated as pushing a `}}` closer, so the enclosing template closed one brace
early.

```text
{{y|def={{{def|no}}}}}    inner was "y|def={{{def|no}}", dropping a brace
                          → the leftover re-read as {{def|no}}
                          → a bogus transclusion of Template:Def
```

PHP is explicit that the closer for an argument reference is `}}}`: its
`preproc_piece` scans tplarg contents with `preproc_stop="}}}"` and admits a `}`
only when it is not followed by `}}` (`&<preproc_stop=="}}}"> !"}}"`).

The fix has **two** halves, and skipping either one is wrong:

- Treat a `{{{…}}}` as closed by `}}}` — otherwise the enclosing template is
truncated (above).
- Reject a `{{{` that is not a well-formed argument reference, falling back to
  reading the `{` as ordinary content — otherwise `{{{!}}` breaks. `{{{!}}` is
  not an argument reference at all; it is `{` + `{{!}}`, the idiom that renders
  `{|` and opens a table, and it has no `}}}`.

Half of the fix alone passes the corpus reproduction but drops the fixture suite
from 871 to 869 (`Template pre: Table`). Both halves together: 871/891
unchanged, and `Template:Def` requests go from 1813 to **zero**.

This is also why the fixture suite never caught it. The bogus token lives in an
argument value, so it only expands if the template actually *uses* that
parameter. Fixture templates are small and ignore their last argument; a real
infobox uses every one. `{{T|p={{{x|default}}}}}` and `{{T|p={{{x|}}}}}`
behaved differently — only the first leaves a well-formed `{{x|default}}`
behind — which no fixture distinguished.

**Still open.** With that fixed, a warm-cache online run of `Israel` *still* does
not terminate: ~198000 requests against 9 network fetches. It is not a cycle in
`Template:Def`'s sense — the longest run of identical consecutive requests is
24 — but a runaway expansion tree, most likely the exponential blowup that
MediaWiki bounds with its preprocessor node-count limit, which rustoid does not
implement. `#ifexist` and `#invoke` are both unimplemented, and the offending
templates (`Template:Country topics`) lean on both, so this probably belongs
with the Phase 3 `#invoke` work rather than here.

#### The first real scoreboard, and what it says to build next

With 44 of the 48 corpus pages cached (the other four, including the stalling
`Israel`, are recorded as skipped), the offline corpus run reports:

```
score: 0/44 compared (0.0%)
output: parsoid 57196568 bytes, rustoid 311357289 bytes (5.44x)

unexpanded wikitext (rustoid side):
  pages with literal {{...}}         43/44
  pages with literal {{#invoke:      43/44
  more literal syntax than parsoid   41/44
```

The second histogram is the one that matters. Every page but `Module:Math` — a
module *source* page, which by nature contains no `#invoke` — leaves Scribunto
calls in its output as literal text:

| page | rustoid `{{#invoke:` | rustoid `{{…}}` | parsoid `{{…}}` |
|---|---|---|---|
| COVID-19 pandemic | 16366 | 20942 | 34 |
| Cristiano Ronaldo | 3337 | 16381 | 51 |
| Hydrogen | 617 | 83626 | 1 |
| Quicksilver (film) | 18 | 289 | 2 |

Two conclusions, both measured rather than assumed:

1. **`#invoke` is the blocker, not a feature among many.** No page can match
   while `{{#invoke:…}}` is emitted as text, because those calls nest: one
   unexpanded call leaves the whole subtree of wikitext behind it, which is why
   the counts are enormous (Hydrogen: 83626) and why the output is 5.44x Parsoid's.
2. **The tag table is not yet a prioritisation tool.** Every tag reads `0/N`
   because a page carries several tags and contributes a failure to each, so
   `cite 0/40` does not mean citation handling is broken — it means 40
   cite-tagged pages fail, for any reason. Attributing by cause needs either
   single-tag entries or a per-page cause, which is what the `unexpanded`
   histogram is a first step towards.

The `unexpanded` metric exists because the first-difference classifier could not
do this job: it reported 41 of 44 pages as `transclusion`, because that marker is
simply what appears in the first 400 bytes of every article. "The infobox
rendered differently" and "the infobox was never rendered" need telling apart,
and only the latter is fixed by working on `#invoke`.

### Phase 3 — `#invoke` end to end (the biggest single lever) — *partly done*

- Wire `invoke` into the parser-function dispatch and build the module loader
  (`Module:` namespace, `require`, `package.loaders`, `mw.loadData`). — **done**:
  `#invoke` is intercepted in the async parser (it needs to fetch, and the
  parser-function path is synchronous), `require`/`mw.loadData` resolve from a
  preloaded registry, and `mw.getCurrentFrame` returns the live frame.
- Frame API, in this order: `frame.args`, `getParent`, `getTitle`,
  **`expandTemplate`**, **`callParserFunction`**, `preprocess`, `newChild`,
  `argumentPairs`. — `args` (both spellings), `argumentPairs`, `getTitle`,
  `getParent` (nil), `extensionTag` are in; `expandTemplate`,
  `callParserFunction`, `preprocess` and `newChild` are **not**, and report an
  error rather than returning something plausible-but-wrong.

#### How modules are fetched, and the trade that was made

Scribunto's `require` is a synchronous Lua call, so the modules a `#invoke` can
reach are **preloaded** before the module runs: the parser fetches the entry
module, scans its source for `require`/`mw.loadData` *string literals*, fetches
those, and repeats (bounded, and cycle-safe). `require` inside Lua is then a
registry lookup.

The trade, stated plainly: a module that computes a module name at runtime
(`require('Module:' .. name)`) cannot be anticipated, and its `require` fails
with a named error. The alternative — rewriting the Lua integration for async —
is a much larger change, and the literal form is what real modules use. The
scan also means `mw.title(...).exists` currently reports `true` rather than
consulting a data source; `LuaSite` is a deliberate snapshot of what Lua may
observe, and widening it is follow-up work.

- **Strip markers.** Scribunto protects non-wikitext output with `\127'"`UNIQ…`
  markers that must survive the round trip back through the parser. Getting this
  wrong produces subtly mangled output everywhere, so it belongs in this phase.
  — **not started**.
- **Exit criterion:** a page whose infobox is module-driven matches byte-exactly.
  — not yet; see below for where it stands.

### Phase 4 — Lua API breadth

- `mw.ustring` complete (`gsub`/`gmatch`/`find`/`match`/`sub`/`rep`/…), then
  `mw.title` completeness, `mw.site`, `mw.message` with real i18n lookup,
  `mw.text`, `mw.html`, `mw.language`, `mw.uri`.
- `mw.title:getContent`/`exists`/`redirectTarget` via `DataSource`;
  `mw.dumpObject`, `mw.log`, `mw.addWarning`, `mw.getCurrentFrame`.
- Instruction-count and memory limits enforced, with a wall-clock timeout.
- **Exit criterion:** the score on the module-heavy corpus moves materially.

### Phase 5 — On-wiki extensions

- **Cite first** (`<ref>`, `<references>`): names and groups, back-links, the
  `mw:Extension/ref` wrapper with its `data-mw` body, and the `<references>`
  list assembly. This is the most-used extension after Lua.
- Then Poem, finishing Gallery, SyntaxHighlight/Source, Math, Templatedata,
  Templatestyles; then the placeholder-semantics ones (Timeline, Graph,
  Mapframe).
- This needs the extension API widened from `-> Result<String>` to a token/DOM
  level so handlers can emit `mw:Extension/<name>` with `data-mw`/`data-parsoid`,
  and so they can be *hybrid* (part wikitext, part HTML) as Parsoid's are.
- **Exit criterion:** pages with references match.

### Phase 6 — Integrated-mode semantics

- Close the gap to MW core's preprocessor where it differs from Parsoid
  standalone — the cause of the `+integrated`-only divergences already logged in
  `REMAINING-BUCKETS.md`.
- **Exit criterion:** the previously-"unreachable" fixture family becomes
  reachable and passing.

### Phase 7 — Scale and hardening

- Large pages, deep transclusion, resource limits, parallelism, cache
  management, resumable batches, and a perf budget.

## Risks

- **Scribunto fidelity is open-ended.** `Module:Citation/CS1` alone is thousands
  of lines of Lua. Expect long tail; measure by corpus score, not by "done".
- **Determinism.** See "What exact equality cannot mean" above. The fix (record
  and replay time/stats) must land in Phase 0, or every score is noisy.
- **Rate limits and ToS.** Polite fetching, caching, and revision pinning are
  correctness requirements, not polish.
- **Integrated-mode preprocessor differences are subtle and un(der)documented.**
  They will be found by differential testing, not by reading.
- **The extension API's current shape is too narrow** and will need widening
  before Cite can be faithful; budget for that in Phase 5 rather than assuming it
  is a small patch.

## How progress is measured

Per wiki and corpus: pages matching byte-exactly, plus a histogram of first-
difference categories. The fixture score (currently 871/891) remains the guard
for the shared core, so this work must not regress it.
